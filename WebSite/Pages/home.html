                      <li>Saving themselves from the iconoclasm of Aurangzeb, the priest of the Shrinathji Temple at Vrindavan sought refuge in Rajasthan. When no ruler dared to call upon wrath of the Mughal Emperor, Maharana Raj Singh stood up and is believed to have declared that Aurangzeb cannot even touch the idols of Shrinath ji until he trampled over the bodies of his 1 lakh Mewar warriors. Under the protection of the Maharana, the idol of Shrinathji was installed at Nathdwara in the Aravallis.</li>

                  <h1>The Historiography Series Lectures</h1>
                  <p>The Historiography Series is an ongoing lecture series at Historical India that attempts in this direction, to equip students with the necessary skills to read, interpret and eventually write history. With a multitude of narratives getting traction, and political motives getting injected into these, the discipline of history is unfortunately becoming the biggest casualty. We believe that it is essential to get an idea of how history is to be written and understood, so that a foundation can be established for future discourse and debate. The objective of this series is the formulation of a Historiography policy document that shall be made part of the website&rsquo;s content policy.</p>
                  <h2>The First Lecture</h2>
                  <p>Historiography Series at Historical India was held on 8th March, 2022 at the Gandhi Bhawan, University of Delhi. The lecture deliberated upon "Revisiting Indian historiography" and was delivered by Dr. Saumya Dey, Rishihood University, with Chief Guest Dr. Ramesh Bharadwaj, HoD, Sanskrit, DU (now Vice-Chancellor, Maharishi Valmiki Sanskrit University, Kaithal, Haryana).</p>
                  <h2>The Second Lecture</h2>
                  <p>The Second Lecture of the Historiography Series at Historical India was held on 24th April, 2022 at Daulat Ram College, Delhi University.

Professor, Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).</p>
                  <h2>The Third Lecture</h2>
                  <p>The Third lecture of the Historiography Series at Historical India was held on 25th June, 2022 online through video conferencing via Udaipur. The lecture deliberated on "The Significance of Rajasthani Sources in the Reconstruction of Medieval Indian History. The lecture was delivered by senior historian and famed author Prof. K. S. Gupta. To our utmost grief, the third lecture was Professor Gupta's last public event before he left us for the heavenly abode on 7th August, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

                  <h2>Netaji, Azad Hind Sarkar and Fauj</h2>
                  <p>The Bharat Book Club is all set for its first official book launch event scheduled for August 13th, 2022 as a part of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, celebrations commemorating 75 years of Independence.

                  <h2>Jadunath Sarkar</h2>

                  </figure>
                  <p>Sir Jadunath Sarkar was the most scholarly among pre-independence historians, who based his historiography mainly on objective evidences. His seminal five-volume History of Aurangzib and other works bring out the bitter truth about the deliberately glorified Mughals. His Military History of India is also considered to be fundamental, so are his works on Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj and annals of Maratha History. He has massively contributed in bringing forward the history of Mughal India, which was mainly in oblivion due to it being mostly recorded in Persian. Jadunath Sarkar was also the first historian to investigate Rajasthani sources in right earnest.</p>
                  <h2>R. C. Majumdar</h2>
